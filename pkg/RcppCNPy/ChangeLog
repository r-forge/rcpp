	* Initial version 0.0.1

	* src/cnpy.{cpp,h}: Numerous minor changes to conform to CRAN Policy

	* src/cnpyMod.cpp: Rcpp modules wrapping of two function npyLoad and
	npySave which work on one- and two-dimensional objects of integer or
	numeric type.  Note that Matrices need a transpose due to numpy
	Fortran ordering.
