\section{Changes in version 0.0.2 (2012-07-05)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added automatic use of transpose to automagically account for
    Fortran-vs-C major storage defaults between Python and R.
    \item Added support for reading gzip'ed files ending in ".npy.gz"
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.0.1 (2012-07-04)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Initial version, as a straightforward Rcpp modules wrap around
    the \code{cpny} library by Carl Rogers (on github under a MIY
    licens).
    \item At present, \code{npy} files can be read and written for
    vectors and matrices of either \code{numeric} or \code{integer} type.
    Note however that matrices are currently \emph{transposed} because
    of the default Fortran ordering done by numpy.
