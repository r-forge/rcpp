Description: This package provides R with access to the cnpy library written
 by Carl Rogers which provides read and write facilities for files created
 with (or for) the NumPy extension for Python.  Vectors and matrices of
 numeric types can be read or written to and from files as well as compressed
 files. Support for integer files is available if the package (and Rcpp) have
 been compiled with -std=c++0x.
