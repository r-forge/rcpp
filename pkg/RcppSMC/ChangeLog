	* DESCRIPTION: Version 0.0.2

	* inst/include/rngR.h: New implementation of the RNG class, relying
	solely on R thus removing the need to build against the GSL

	* inst/include/rng.hh: #ifdef'ed out as GNU GSL RNGs no longer used
	* src/rng.cc: Idem
	* src/simfunctions.cc: Idem; and two calls changed from GSL to R

	* inst/include/sampler.hh: Comment out ctor with GSL RNG type
	* inst/include/smctc.hh: Include new rngR.h instead of rng.hh
	* src/pffuncs.cc: Idem

	* src/Makevars: Remove GSL vars for compilation

	* src/rareEventsEx.cpp: Adapted main() from rare-events/main.cc in
	the SMCTC sources
	* src/simfunctions.hh: Also imported from rare-events/, and renamed

	* Initial commit to R-Forge; package is still very bare but at least
	passes R CMD check now that it has a man page too

	* Bare-bones wrapping of Adam Johansen's nice SMCTC library described
