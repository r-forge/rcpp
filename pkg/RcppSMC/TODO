 * Add more examples

 * Maybe remove example 2 from the JSS paper

 * Maybe rename example 1 from the JSS paper -- what would be a good
   name instead of 'pfEx'? Idem for the C++ code.

 * For blockpfGaussianOpt et al, we could be fancy and return an S3 object
   with a plot method.  Maybe later.

 * Once we are happy with the GSL -> R rng switch, we can remove all
   commented-out references to the GSL
