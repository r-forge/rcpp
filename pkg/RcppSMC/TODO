 * Add more examples

 * Maybe remove example 2 from the JSS paper

 * Should src/* files be named *.cc or *.cpp or mixed?  DE doesn't
   care much either way, but prefers consistency -- so far it's *.cc
   for the SMC code.

 * Dito for headers: DE mostly uses .h out of convention; .hh or .hpp
   actually make more sense; whatever works with Emacs is fine by me

 * For blockpfGaussianOpt, we could be fancy and return an S3 object
   with a plot method.  Maybe later.

 * Once we are happy with the GSL -> R rng switch, we can remove all
   commented-out references to the GSL
