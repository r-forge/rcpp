	* src/glmFamily.cpp, src/glmFamily.h: cache the Functions in the
	list.  Transformation methods are now const (without needing a
	const_cast).

	* DESCRIPTION (Depends): Change Rcpp dependence to >= 0.8.9.2 to
	ensure that the Function operator() is const.

	* R/zzz.R (.onLoad): Use a less visible name for the environment.

	* R/fastGlm.R (fastGlm): Perform IRLS iterations before return.
	Right now these are rather crude (no error checking).  Still need
	to decide if they should be done in R code or C++ code.  Guess
	I'll just write it both ways and then decide.

	* tests/pois.R: Added the Gamma examples from McCullagh & Nelder

	* src/glmFamily.h (glm): Corrected the expression for GammaDevRes.

	* DESCRIPTION (Depends): Corrected minor, perhaps benign, typo

	* src/Module.cpp: definition of the Rcpp module

	* src/glmFamily.cpp, src/glmFamily.h: A class representing a glm
	family.

	* src/RcppModels.cpp, src/RcppModels.h: Classes for linear and
	generalized linear response modules and for dense predictor
	modules.

	* tests/pois.R: An example from Dobson.  The Gauss-Newton version
	of IRLS is currently being done by hand.  This will change.

	* man/RccpModels-package.Rd: initial package documentation

	* inst/unitTests: installed unit tests of some of the glmFamily
	methods.

	* R/fastGlm.R (fastGlm): draft glm function using C++Class
	instances. Have not yet added the Gauss-Newton steps but do have
	one fixed-point step.

	* R/zzz.R (.onLoad): populate the namespace with module contents

	* DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE: initial release
