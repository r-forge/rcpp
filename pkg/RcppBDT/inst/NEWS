0.2.0   2012-06-30

    o   The core module, which wraps what in C++ is boost::gregorian::date, 
        is now exposed as an Rcpp module bdtDate.  As all example as demos
        operated off a (package-global) variable 'bdt', no user visible
        change was needed outside of the code instantiating at package load.

    o   Updated package instantiation to the new facilities offered by the
        current versions R 2.15.1 and Rcpp 0.9.13 

0.1.0   2011-01-17

    o   First CRAN upload (and see ChangeLog for more granular details)
