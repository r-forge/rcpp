News for Package 'RcppBDT'

Changes in version 0.2.0 (2012-06-30):

        • The core module, which wraps what in C++ is
          boost::gregorian::date, is now exposed as an Rcpp module
          bdtDate.  As all example and demos operated off a
          (package-global) variable 'bdt', no user visible change was
          needed outside of the code instantiating at package load.

        • Updated package instantiation to the new facilities offered
          by the current versions R 2.15.1 and Rcpp 0.9.13

Changes in version 0.1.0 (2011-01-17):

        • First CRAN upload (and see ChangeLog for more granular
          details) bug fix in svm cross validation
