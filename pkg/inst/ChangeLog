2009-12-17  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* R/RcppInline.R: Improved / simplified in light of getting it to
 	  work on Windoze too so switched to setting env var explicitly;
	  also split into three args for CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LIBS
	* man/RcppInline.Rd: Updated accordingly to reflect new args
        * inst/examples/RcppInline/RcppInlineWithLibsExamples.r: Idem

	* R/RcppInline.R: Imported function 'cfunction' from the inline
  	  package, along with small patch to directly support Rcpp. The
	  inclusion may be temporary -- if our patch is integrated into
	  inline we may just depend on that package
        * man/RcppInline.Rd: Imported from inline, plus change for Rcpp
        * inst/examples/RcppInline/RcppInlineExample.r: Small example
	  taken from the 'Intro to HPC with R' tutorials

	* src/RcppList.{h,cpp}: Added a simple class to accept list()
	  objects in order to cope with non-rectangular data-types -- this
	  comes from the RProtoBuf code currently only on r-forge where
	  we need accept lists that are potentially nested.
	  The API for RcppList is not fully fleshed out and needs a few
	  more append() member functions. Also length is currently fixed.

	* cleanup: Change header file removal to Rcpp*.h

	* inst/README: Added short README about history and status

	* inst/doc/: Updated doxygen documentation

2009-09-29  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@dexter>

        * inst/doc/{html,latex,man}: Added new documentation of the C++ classes
	* doxyfile: Added Doxygen configuration file for doc generation

	  rather than via 'using namespace std'

2009-02-18  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	  loop variable; all to make 'g++ -Wall' happy

2009-01-09  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Release 0.6.3

	* R/RcppLdpath.R: Also defined shorter functions CxxFlags() and
	  LdFlags() which cat() the longer forms RcppCxxFlags() and
	  RcppLdFlags() to further simplify use via litter or Rscript in
	  Makefile or Makevars

	* man/Rcpp-package.Rd: Mention short form CxxFlags() and LdFlags()

	* src/Makevars: Applied another build correction for OS X suggested
	  by Simon Urbanek

	* src/Rcpp.{cpp,h}: Added 'view-only' classes RcppVectorView,
	  RcppMatrixView and RcppStringVectorView contributed by David Reiss

2008-12-02  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Release 0.6.2

	* R/RcppLdPath.R: Correct output for the default Linux case

2008-11-30  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Release 0.6.1

	* src/Makevars: Added, replacing src/Makefile: thanks to Simon for a
	  rewrite that provides OS X support
	* src/Makefile: Retired
	* src/Makefile.win: Now build libRcpp.a instead of Rcpp.a

	* src/Rcpp.{cpp,h}: Removed #ifdef statements related to QuantLib and
	  Date ops as we no longer need to split this off -- one build for all
	  uses; also added another date offset for the difference between the
	  Unix epoch of Jan 1, 1970 and what certain spreadsheets use (which is
	  what QuantLib) follows.  With this change, Rcpp is completely
	  decoupled from QuantLib headers, yet can be used from QuantLib 0.2.10
	  or later. However, this also removes data conversion from R/Rcpp to
	  QL as Rcpp no longer 'knows' QL.

	* R/RcppLdPath.R: Adds new functions RcppLdPath() to return lib/
	  directory path, and RcppLdFlags() to return arguments, including the
	  optional rpath settings on Linux

	* R/RcppExample.R: Added new example 'RcppVectorExample()', extended
	  default print method for examples

	* man/Rcpp-package.Rd: Expanded / updated documentation of package
	  use when building other packages

	* cleanup: Removing static libraries too but do not remove src/Makevars

2008-11-05  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* Release 0.6.0

	* New maintainer

	* src/Makefile{,.win}: New files, including functionality from both
 	  configure and RcppSrc/Makefile; we now build two libraries, one for
	  use by the package which also runs the example, and one for users to
	  link against
	* src/Makevars.in: Removed
	* src/Rcpp.{cpp,h}: moved in from ../RcppSrc

	* src/Rcpp.{cpp,h}: Add new type RcppDatetime corresponding to
  	  POSIXct in with full support for microsecond time resolution
	  between R and C++

	* man/*: Several new manual pages added

	* configure{,.in,.win}: Removed as src/Makefile* can handle this more
	  easily

	* DESCRIPTION: Minor cleanup and reformatting, Date: now uses
  	  svn:keyword Date property

	* NAMESPACE: Renamed RcppTemplateVersion to RcppVersion,
	  deleted RcppDemo

	* demo/ directory removed as vignette("RcppAPI") is easier and more
	  reliable to show vignette documentation

	* R/zzz.R: RcppTemplateDemo() removed, vignette("RcppAPI") is easier
	* man/RcppTemplateDemo.Rd removed as well

	* R/RcppExample.R: reindented, rewritten to set default arguments

	* R/RcppTemplateVersion.R: renamed to RcppVersion.R
	* man/RcppTemplateVersion.Rd: renamed to RcppVersion.Rd

	* RcppSrc/Rcpp.{cpp,h}: moved to src/ directory
	* RcppSrc/Makefile{,.win}: removed

	* inst/doc/RcppAPI.{Rnw,pdf}: Added footnote onto titlepage about how
	  this document has not (yet) been updated along with the channges made
