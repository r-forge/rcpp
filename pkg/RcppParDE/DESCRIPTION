Title: Global optimization by differential evolution in C++ using OpenMP parallel computing
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel extending DEoptim (by David Ardia, Katharine Mullen,
  Brian Peterson, Joshua Ulrich) which itself is based on DE-Engine (by Rainer Storn)
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: This package provides an efficient C++ based implementation of the
  DEoptim function which performs global optimization by differential evolution. 
  It builds on RcppDE package which aims to show that "easier, shorter,
  faster: pick any three" is achievable when moving code from plain old C to
  modern C++ --- and attempts to reap further gains by using parallel
  execution using the OpenMP framework for multithreaded computing on
  multicore systems.
