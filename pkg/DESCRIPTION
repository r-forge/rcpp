Description: R/C++ interface classes and examples
 The Rcpp library maps data types betweeen R and C++, and includes support
 for R types real, integer, character, vector, matrix, Date, datetime (i.e.
 POSIXct) at microsecond resolution, data frame, and function. Transfer to and
 from simple SEXP objects is particular easy. Calling R functions from C++ is
 also supported.
 .
 C++ code can be 'inlined' by using the 'inline' package which will create a
 C++ function and compile, link and load it given the 'inlined' character
 argument which makes C++ integration very easy.
 .
 Several examples are included.
Depends: R (>= 2.0.0)
