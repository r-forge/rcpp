This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-rcpp package of Rcpp, an
R / C++ interface package. Rcpp was written by Dominick Samperi
and Dirk Eddelbuettel.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
as well the R-Forge SVN host at 
	http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rcpp/
via
   	svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rcpp


The package was renamed from its upstream name 'Rcpp' to
'r-cran-rcpp' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.
