	* inst/include/RcppGSLForward.h : add indexing operator, stl iterator and 
	begin() and end() methods to RcppGSL::vector using proxy classes
	
	* inst/include/RcppGSLForward.h : RcppGSL::matrix gets indexing 
	operator(int,int)
	
	* configure.win: added empty configure.win so that R CMD check does not
	get jealous about the configure script
	
	* src/Makevars.win: use Brian Ripley's suggestions to anticipate R 2.12.0

	* inst/include/*.h: RcppGSL::vector_view and RcppGSL::matrix_view

	* R/fastLm.R: fastLm is now generic and behaves similar to lm():
	formula interface, returns object of class 'fastLm', and had methods
	for print, summary and predict
	* man/fasttLm.Rd: documented interface accordingly
	* src/fastLm.cpp: Added covariance matrix and degrees of freedom to
	list of result returned from C++ to R

	* inst/include/*.h: wrap specializations are now inline

	* inst/include/*.h: new classes RcppGSL::matrix<T> and RcppGSL::matrix_view<T>

	* src/fastLm.cpp : added fastLm from Rcpp examples

2010-05-12  Romain Francois <romain@r-enthusiasts.com>

	* inst/include/*.h: added classes RcppGSL::vector<T> that act as smart pointers
	to gsl_vector_* objects. This gives nicer syntax and helps Rcpp implicit
	converters wrap and as.
