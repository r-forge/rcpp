Description: Rcpp integration for GNU GSL vectors and matrices
  The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of numerical routines for
  scientifc computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it
  provides a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical routines
  such as special functions, permutations, combinations, fast fourier
  transforms, eigensystems, random numbers, quadrature, random distributions,
  quasi-random sequences, Monte Carlo integration, N-tuples, differential
  equations, simulated annealing, numerical differentiation, interpolation,
  series acceleration, Chebyshev approximations, root-finding, discrete
  Hankel transforms physical constants, basis splines and wavelets.  There
  are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.
  .
  The RcppGSL package provides an easy-to-use interface between GSL data
  structures and R using concepts from Rcpp which is itself a package that
  eases the interfaces between R and C++.
