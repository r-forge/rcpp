Subject: [R] Find number of elements less than some number: Elegant/fast
	solution needed
Date: Thu, 14 Apr 2011 14:34:44 -0500

Take vector x and a subset y:

x=1:10

y=c(4,5,7,9)

For each value in 'x', I want to know how many elements in 'y' are less than 'x'.

An example would be:

sapply(x,FUN=function(i) {length(which(y<i))})
 [1] 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 3 3 4

But this solution is far too slow when x and y have lengths in the millions.

I'm certain an elegant (and computationally efficient) solution exists, but I'm in the weeds at this point.

Any help is much appreciated.

Take two vectors x and y, where y is a subset of x:

x=1:10

y=c(2,5,6,9)

If y is removed from x, the original x values now have a new placement (index) in the resulting vector (new): 

new=x[-y]

index=1:length(new)

The challenge is: How can I *quickly* and *efficiently* deduce the new 'index' value directly from the original 'x' value -- using only 'y' as an input?

In practice, I have very large matrices containing the 'x' values, and I need to convert them to the corresponding 'index' if the 'y' values are removed.
