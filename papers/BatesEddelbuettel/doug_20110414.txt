Subject: Re: [Rcpp-devel] [R] Find number of elements less than some number:
 Elegant/fastsolution needed
Date: Thu, 14 Apr 2011 17:22:53 -0500

My colleague Sunduz Keles once mentioned a similar problem to me.  She
had a large sample from a reference distribution and a test sample
(both real-valued in her case) and she wanted, for each element of the
test sample, the proportion of the reference sample that was less than
the element.  It's a type of empirical p-value calculation.

I forget the exact sizes of the samples (do you remember, Sunduz?) but
they were in the tens of thousands or larger.  Solutions in R tended
to involve comparing every element in the test sample to every element
in the reference sample but, of course, that is unnecessary.  If you
sort both samples then you can start the comparisons for a particular
element of the test sample at the element of the reference sample
where the last comparison failed.

I was able to write a very short C++ function using the Rcpp package
that provided about a 1000-fold increase in speed relative to the best
I could do in R.  I don't have the script on this computer so I will
post it tomorrow when I am back on the computer at the office.

Apologies for cross-posting to the Rcpp-devel list but I am doing so
because this might make a good example of the usefulness of Rcpp and
inline.
